       How much data is behind the MGD report? How many people does it represent?

       <p> 
       Use this visualization to explore how much data has been collected about each of the millenium goals. Learn
       how much of Earth's population is represented in each of data points collected. See for which goals the UN is making progress in collecting more  
       data in recent years.
